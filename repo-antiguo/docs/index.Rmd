## This is the project website for the development and testing of the "Perceived an Just Taxes in Chile: A factorial survey approach"

Last update: `r format(Sys.time(), "%A %d %B %Y %X")`

### Authors:

- Juan Carlos Castillo, Departamento de SociologÃ­a, Universidad de Chile. [juancastillov@uchile.cl](juancastillov@uchile.cl), [jc-castillo.com](http://jc-castillo.com/)

### In brief:

Based on a factorial survey approach, the proposed study design aims answer how the characteristics of a set of vignettes affect the evaluations in relation to the perceived and just income taxes in Chile. Based on a longitudinal two-wave online panel in Chile (N=1800, final wave) we tested our hypothesis through multilevel regression models in which vignettes are nested within respondents.  

- Pre-analysis: [OSF pre-register]

### Structure of the project website:

- The tabs follow the logic of the [IPO protocol](https://github.com/juancarloscastillo/ipo) for academic workflows, based on three main components = **I**nput -> **P**roduction -> **O**utput. Here we show only one the main parts of each component: Data -> Analysis -> Paper. The complete reproducible files are in the [Github repo: https://github.com/juancarloscastillo/factorial-impuestos](https://github.com/juancarloscastillo/factorial-impuestos)

  - _Data_: pre-processing and general descriptives
  - _Analysis_: Analysis
  - _Paper_: final output

### Reproducibility and documentation

The repository of the project in Github is structured according to the [IPO reproducibility protocol](https://juancarloscastillo.github.io/ipo/).
